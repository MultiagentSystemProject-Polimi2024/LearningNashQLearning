# LearningNashQLearning

This is an educational project to see the inner workings of the Nash-Q Learning algorithm. The Nash-Q Learning algorithm is a multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm that is designed to learn Nash equilibria in general-sum stochastic games. This project is designed to be educational and is not intended to be used in production environments.

## How to Use

The main entry point for the project is the `Application.ipynb` notebook. There you can specify a Stochastic Game and run the Nash-Q Learning algorithm on it.

If you are curious about the algorithm implementation you can look at `LearningNashQLearning/LearningNashQLearning/Model/NashQLearning.py`.
