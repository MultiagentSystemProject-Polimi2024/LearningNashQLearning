    "In this notebook you can interact with an educational software that simulates the Nash-Q learning algorithm in a multi-agent system.\n",
    "\n",
    "More in details the software allows you to specify a **Stochastic game** as an enviroment for the agents to explore. The agents will then learn to play the game by interacting with it and updating their knowledge of the environment trying to reach a Nash equilibrium.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is devided in four main widgets:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Presets** : In this widget you can select a preset environment to play with.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Enviroment Editor** : In this widget you can edit the stochastic game enviroment. You can specify the number of agents, the number of games, the number of actions per player per game and the rewards and transition probability per action per game.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Nash Q Learning Editor** : In this widget you can edit the hyperparameters of the agents and train them on the enviroment.\n",
    "    \n",
    "4. **Learning Display** : In this widget you can view the learning process of the agents and the Nash equilibrium reached."

    "\n",
    "> Remember that in the next widget you can always view and edit the environment to your liking.\n",
    "\n",
    "The presets are:\n",
    "\n",
    "0. **Empty preset**: This only selects the minimum number of players (2) and 2 games without any transitions or payoffs. View this preset as a blank canvas for your first simple envs.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Basic 2-2**: Defines an environment with 2 players and 2 games, with deterministic transitions and equal payoffs for each player on every transition.\n",
    "In this setup the most desirable game to be in is  game 1, where it is best for them to stay because of the payoffs. This means that the only Nash-Q equilibrium is playing the action profile (0, 0) in both the games.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Basic 3-2**: Defines an environment with 3 players and 2 games with the same properties of the last one, here the *Nash-Q equilibrium* consists of playing the **action profile** (0, 0, 0) in each game.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Basic 4-2**: Once again same settings but this time with 4 players. The *Nash-Q equilibrium* is the action profile (0, 0, 0, 0)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Stochastic \"Prisoner's Dilemma\"**: A more structured preset that tries to reinterpret the famous \"Prisoner's Dilemma\" in a stochastic game setting. More in details there are 2 players that can either be free (F) or imprisoned (I), this implies the existence of 4 games:\n",
    "\n",
    "    **0 - FF** - In this game the players are both free. Unfortunatly their nature doesn't allow them to be free for long. Sooner or later they always end up committing a crime and years of friendship compels them to commit crimes together. The same feelings are inevitably tested though, because they inevitably end up caught.\n",
    "    Each of them is then presented with a choice: they can either stay silent (S) or testify against the other (T). If both player confess they will get 2 years of prison each, if one confesses and the other stays silent the one that confessed will be free and the other will get 3 years of prison, if they both stay silent they will get 1 year of prison each.\n",
    "    The payoffs are set to reflect these conditions.\n",
    "    The actions SS and TT lead to the game 1 (II), while the actions TS and ST lead to the game 2 (FI) and 3 (IF) respectively.\n",
    "    The payoffs are set in such a way that there is no difference in testifing or not if the other testifies, but remaining silent when the other testifies causes a pretty big negative reward. In this game the Nash-Q equilibrium is testifing for both players (C, C).\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **1 - II** - In this game both players are imprisoned but not all hopes are lost. Since they are both in prison they can work together in trying to escape through the sewers. Unfortunatly only one can fit and then the allarm will go off. They then decide to play a game of rock, paper, scissors to decide who will be released. The winner will be released and the other will have his sentence increased for tring to escape. If they tie they will both return to their cell but still get a smaller increase in their sentence.\n",
    "    This means that they can play 3 actions: rock (R), paper (P), and scissors (S). The one that wins gets a positive reward because he gets released, while the one that loses gets a bigger negative reward because his sentence is increased; in the case of a tie, they both get a small negative reward, because they need to stay in prison with their sentence.  \n",
    "\n",
    "    **2 FI** - In game 2 one of the criminal has testified, while the other has remained silent, so the first is free and the second is in prison. The free one has the choice between *(H)* helping the other criminal escape, or *(I)* ignoring him, while the prisoner can choose between *(E)* escaping or *(R)* remaining in prison. If the first tries to help and the other wants to escape *(H, E)* they both get a small positive reward for tasting freedom once again, while if the second decides to remain in prison *(H, R)*, he gets a small negative reward while the other gets a negative reward because he gets caught in the helping; if the first decides not to help and the second tries to escape *(I, E)*, the second gets a negative reward because he can't actually escape without help, and his sentence is increased, while the first gets a neutral reward; if the second remains in prison *(I, R)*, the second gets a small negative reward while the first still gets a neutral reward.  \n",
    "    \n",
    "    **3 IF** - Game 3 is the same as number 2, but with reversed roles.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **\"Little(grid)world\"**: a small version of a grid-world game where the grid is composed of four tiles in an upside-down T shape (3 horizontal tiles and one on top of the middle one). There are two agents on opposite sides of the board, their aim is to reach the other’s player position. The two agents can perform three actions each: they can either go up (a 0), go down (a 2) or move towards the opposite side of the board to their starting position (a 1).  When hitting a wall, the agent gets a unitary negative reward, when the two agents collide, they both get a double negative reward (-2). In the case of one agent reaching its final position, it gets a strong positive reward (+5), independently if a wall or another agent had been hit.\n",
    "> **❗Note❗**: The graph representation of the game number 5 might be quite hard to comprehend and slow to render (the number of possible states for the system is 12 and the possible actions for each state are 9). For graphic representation refer to the report published on github (https://github.com/MultiagentSystemsProject-Polimi2024/LearningNashQLearning.git). "
